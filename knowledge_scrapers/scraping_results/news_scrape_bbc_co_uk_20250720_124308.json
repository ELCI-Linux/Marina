Local police said 10 people had so far been pulled from the water alive.\nThe devastated mother of a 21-year-old victim said she wished she could change places with her son. \"All I want to do is die\", she cried.\n\"I don't want anything in this world anymore, I'm so tired,\" Nguyen Thi Lien told the Reuters news agency.\nTrang Trung Tu, whose 32-year-old brother died in the incident, said: \"My brother can swim, but I was told everything happened too fast.\"\nThe vessel, named Wonder Seas, was carrying 53 people when it capsized after encountering a sudden storm, a statement from the Vietnamese Border Guards and navy said.\nAn eyewitness told AFP news agency that the sky suddenly darkened around 14:00 local time on Saturday (07:00 GMT).\nThere were \"hailstones as big as toes with torrential rain, thunderstorm and lightning,\" he said.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nAt least one passenger was able to escape from an air pocket in the upturned vessel\nA 10-year-old boy was rescued after being trapped in an air pocket in the upturned hull, local media reported.\n\"I took a deep breath... dived, then swam up. I even shouted for help, then I was pulled up by a boat,\" the boy - who had been travelling with his parents -\ntold VietnamNet\n,\nexternal\n.\nOf the bodies so far recovered, at least eight were children, VNExpress said on Saturday.\nHeavy rain hindered the search for survivors, which continued overnight into Sunday.\nPrime Minister Pham Minh Chinh sent his condolences to the families of the dead.\nAuthorities will investigate the cause of the accident and \"strictly handle violations\", a government statement said.\nHa Long Bay in Quang Ninh province is dotted with hundreds of tiny islets, attracting four million tourists in 2019, and is a Unesco World Heritage site.\nIt was previously reported that 37 people had died and 11 had survived, but police later revised the figure.\nGet in touch",

You're only there a few minutes for them to get their cases and then right back in the car and away again.\"\nImage caption,\nThe pickup and drop-off zone at Edinburgh Airport does not inform drivers about fees on their approach\nDrivers approaching via Eastfield Road pass three roundabouts on the way into the main terminal, the closest of which leads them on to a one-way system which means they have to pass through the drop-off zone.\nThere ",

Now everything is dry.\" She gestures to some grazing llamas.\nFor generations, her family raised sheep here. As the climate changed, and rain stopped falling, less grass made that much harder.\nBut it worsened when \"they\" started taking the water, she explains.\nImage source,\nBen Derico/BBC\nImage caption,\nRaquel's family raised sheep in Chile's Atacama salt flats for generations but now everything is dry, she says\n\"They\" are lithium companies. Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage.\nAs the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared.\nIn 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nBy 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes.\nMost of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says.\nLocals say environmental costs to them have risen too.\nSo, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem?\nFlora, flamingos and shrinking lagoons\nChile is the second-largest producer of lithium globally after Australia. In 2023, the government launched a National Lithium Strategy to ramp up production through partly nationalising the industry and encouraging private investment.\nIts finance minister previously said the increase in production could be by up to 70% by 2030, although the mining ministry says no target has been set.\nThis year, a major milestone to that is set to be reached.\nImage source,\nBen Derico/BBC\nImage caption,\nThe process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region\nA planned joint enterprise between SQM and Chile's state mining company Codelco has just secured regulatory approval for a quota to extract at least 2.5 million metric tonn",

Someone off stage kept trying to take it off him. Incredible.\"\nThe identity of the cast member is unclear, but Il trovatore has now finished its 11-night run at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nThe protest comes as the war between Israel and Gaza continues, with a ceasefire yet to be struck.\nGet in touch\nWere you at the performance?\nContact form\nContact form\nRelated topics\nOpera\nLondon\nTop stories\nSewage discharges to halve by 2030, minister pledges\nPublished\n1 hour ago\nAt least 14 dead in South Korea floods and landslides\nPublished\n3 hours ago\nNew criminal offence to target violence-obsessed suspects earlier\nPublished\n11 hours ago\nMore to explore\nHow the rise ",

But is there an argument for shorter summers at all schools?\nCould a shorter break help with learning? Or do pupils - and teachers - need the time to recharge? Would spreading out school holidays across the year help reduce the cost of family holidays, or would smaller windows create a rush to book time off?\nLet's take a look at some of the issues.\nWould it help parents and pupils?\nBranwen Jeffreys\nEducation Editor\n@branwenjeffreys\nSix weeks is a long time away from learning, especially for children whose parents are working or who can't afford lots of costly day trips, activities or a long family holiday.\nSo while all children may forget a little of what they have learnt, families with more money can enrich their understanding by giving them other experiences, and this widens the learning gap.\nFor many families with children, food is one of the biggest bills. During term time, more than a quarter of children across England are eligible for free school meals, and in some schools, it is closer to half of all pupils.\nAs food costs have risen, there has been growing awareness of what is called holiday hunger, with some families struggling to feed children without school support.\nThere are other factors too. While summer allows for playing outside, footy kickarounds and being in the garden, extending winter holidays may mean families need to heat their homes more in the daytime.\nEngland, Wales and Scotland all have six-week summer breaks, though Scotland's tends to be earlier, finishing in mid-August.\nIn Northern Ireland, schools are closed for all of July and August.\nMost of England's schools are now academies who can set their own holidays, and some have already opted for five weeks in summer and two weeks in October. In Surrey, the county council has\ndecided to follow suit\nfor all the schools it supports from autumn 2026.\nHow we saved hundreds of pounds on our summer holiday\nPublished\n7 days ago\nWhen to book and where to stay: Six ways to save money on your summer holiday\nPublished\n10 July\nIn Wales, that model was put out to consultation, attracting more than 16,000 responses from parents and teachers.
