But here I am.\"\nHampton has been used to setbacks and her career has been far from smooth.\nShe was dropped by England months after being part of the winning Euro 2022 squad.\nShe was forced to prove herself again and has bounced back and risen to the top. This is the story of her journey.\n'She was born to be a footballer'\nWhen Carla Ward arrived at Birmingham City as their new manager in 2020 she had already heard about teenager Hampton.\n\"We spoke on the first day. I wanted to know where she wanted to be,\" Ward told BBC Sport.\n\"She was an endearing character, as well as being a livewire, like most goalkeepers. But she articulated things in a way that was far more mature than her age.\n\"It was on day two that I really saw what everyone was talking about. She was one of the most talented individuals I've ever worked with.\n\"Everyone has different talents but she was born to be a footballer.\"\nHampton's love for football developed in Spain, where she moved with her family at the age of five and learned to speak the language fluently during her five years living there.\nShe was scouted by Villarreal's academy after former Argentine defender Fabio Fuentes recommended Hampton go to a club trial.\nOn her return to England, she joined Stoke City's academy before eventually breaking into the first team at Birmingham City at the age of 16 - switching positions from a striker to a goalkeeper.\nShe",

When BBC pundit Ellen White\ndescribed it as \"terrifying watching\"\n, she was spot on \u2013 this was the football coach's version of The Exorcist.\nOf course, shootouts are a scary prospect for any participant, with so much on the line and the spectre of failure and embarrassment so present.\nWhile the myth of penalties being a lottery has been dispelled in the era of football coaching driven by data and psychology, you can never quite predict what the pressure will do to a player, even at the elite level.\nAs Alan Shearer memorably exclaimed as England's men celebrated their\nshootout victory over Switzerland at Euro 2024\n: \"Pressure is for tyres.\"\nInspired by the Lionesses' chaotic triumph in Zurich, here are some of the greatest moments when the tyre exploded...\nMiss, and miss, and miss\u2026\nImage source,\nReuters\nImage caption,\nHelmuth Duckadam's European Cup final heroics came in his final game for Steaua Bucharest\nEngland became the first side at the Women's Euros to miss three successive penalties in a shootout and still go through.\nThe 36% conversion rate of spot-kicks in Zurich was the worst of any shootout in the competition's history, lower than the\n2017 semi-final between Denmark and Austria.\nThat shootout saw Denmark progress 3-0 on penalties \u2013 four of the seven spot-kicks were missed, including all three from the Austrians.\nBut for the worst shootout on a major European stage, there is only one answer: the 1986 European Cup final.\nAfter a tedious goalless 120 minutes between Barcelo",

As in, they'll be so desperate to keep the series alive in Melbourne on Saturday they'll metamorphose into a team of belligerence and belief - a band of brothers who will blow the Lions away.\n\"We expect them to be desperate,\" said Lions centre Sione Tuipulotu after the\n27-19 victory.\n\"When an Australia team becomes desperate, it's difficult to handle,\" said head coach Andy Farrell.\n\"The desperation is all on the line for them at the weekend,\" said prop Tadhg Furlong.\nFlanker Tadhg Beirne also spoke about Australian desperation. So did Wallabies head coach Joe Schmidt, repeatedly, and so did his replacement scrum-half Tate McDermott and others.\nAnd they will be desperate, no question, but how far does desperation get you?\nSchmidt said his team had desperation written all over their performance in Brisbane, and he meant it as a compliment. He admired their hunger and their refusal to wilt.\nFarrell said the Wallabies would be a different team\nin Melbourne. Maybe. Or maybe we're reading too much into the desperation thing. Maybe they're just an Australia team early in their development and out of their depth in games such as this.\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nThis video can not be played\nMedia caption,\nMore to come from Lions after opening win - Farrell\nFor drama and intrigue, we want the series to go to the wire, so we construct an argument around that.\nThe fightback exposed weaknesses in the Lions make-up. Things might have been closer had big calls gone with the Wallabies - a possible yellow card for Tom Curry for taking Tom Lynagh in the air, a possible yellow for Furlong going high on Len Ikitau, a possible yellow for a Ben Earl no-arms tackle ",
