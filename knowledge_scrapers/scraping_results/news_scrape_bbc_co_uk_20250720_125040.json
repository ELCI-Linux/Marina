A topic frequently discussed but that never goes away.\nOnly 72.3 overs were bowled on day two of the third Test at Lord's.\nThat means, including the necessary time taken for a change of innings, 15 overs were lost from the match not because of rain or bad light but because of the slowness of play.\nA further 19 overs were lost over days three and four.\nThere was\nIndian frustration\nat the end of day three as England opener Zak Crawley used delaying tactics, meaning one over took seven minutes.\nEngland have subsequently been\ndocked two points\nin the World Test Championship (WTC) and fined 10% of their match fee for a slow over-rate.\nThey were deemed to be below the required rate despite mitigating circumstances, including India captain Shubman Gill having an eight-minute massage on the outfield and Ravindra Jadeja taking a toilet break while batting on day five.\nThe stoppages are a poor look for the sport, but what are the rules, do over-rates matter and what can be done?\nWhat are the rules?\nIn a five-day Test, 90 overs are scheduled for each day.\nTo prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw, all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day, barring interruptions for the weather.\nOn the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half hour made available at the end of the day.\nWhile time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.\nThere are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have limited impact.\nAn umpire can, after an",

The first spotted Broadbent had knocked on before freeing Lewis and the second noticed the stand-off had dropped the ball as he touched down.\nThe league leaders made sure in the second half.\nBurgess raced clear from a pass by Broadbent, who grabbed his second from another slick Lewis pass.\nCatalans found so",

As in, they'll be so desperate to keep the series alive in Melbourne on Saturday they'll metamorphose into a team of belligerence and belief - a band of brothers who will blow the Lions away.\n\"We expect them to be desperate,\" said Lions centre Sione Tuipulotu after the\n27-19 victory.\n\"When an Australia team becomes desperate, it's difficult to handle,\" said head coach Andy Farrell.\n\"The desperation is all on the line for them at the weekend,\" said prop Tadhg Furlong.\nFlanker Tadhg Beirne also spoke about Australian desperation. So did Wallabies head coach Joe Schmidt, repeatedly, and so did his replacement scrum-half Tate McDermott and others.\nAnd they will be desperate, no question, but how far does desperation get you?\nSchmidt said his team had desperation written all over their performance in Brisbane, and he meant it as a compliment. He admired their hunger and their refusal to wilt.\nFarrell said the Wallabies would be a different team\nin Melbourne. Maybe. Or maybe we're reading too much into the desperation thing. Maybe they're just an Australia team early in their development and out of their depth in games such as this.\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nThis video can not be played\nMedia caption,\nMore to come from Lions after opening win - Farrell\nFor drama and intrigue, we want the series to go to the wire, so we construct an argument around that.\nThe fightback exposed weaknesses in the Lions make-up. Things might have been closer had big calls gone with the Wallabies - a possible yellow card for Tom Curry for taking Tom Lynagh in the air, a possible yellow for Furlong going high on Len Ikitau, a possible yellow for a Ben Earl no-arms tackle ",

Rashford's number 10 shirt was given to Cunha.\nSince their exile, the only significant development involving the quintet was news that they cannot access United's Carrington training ground - which they can enter for rehabilitation and medical purposes - until Amorim and his squad have left for the day.\nThe members of the so-called 'bomb squad', a reference to their being bombed out, can train together at Ca",

Whereas this is the Dukes in England, Tests in India are played with an SG ball, while the Kookaburra is used in Australia.\nThe Dukes, in production since 1760, has long been regarded as a high-quality product but there have been issues in Test and county cricket in recent years.\nIt has been going soft prematurely - long before it should be changed after 80 overs of an innings - and when a ball goes soft taking wickets becomes harder. Bowlers say there is not the same zip off the pitch and fewer edges carry to fielders.\nThe ECB's Professional Game Committee and Cricket Advisory Group analyses data collected in relation to balls across the season. This would include the number of balls changed, along with reports from umpires and captains.\nConversations around the quality of balls have been monitored in recent years and there is an awareness of increased instances of balls becoming softer more quickly but",

This makes the seam more pronounced than the Kookaburra and it maintains its shape for longer, favouring bowlers searching for seam and swing movement.\nThe Kookaburra is machine stitched and does not have the same handicraft in its manufacturing. It does swing initially, but loses its shape more quickly and becomes softer.\nHowever, it is better suited to cricket played on dry, hard pitches, as are usually found in Australia, to cope with the abrasive surfaces.\nIn Test cricket, the Dukes ball is used in England, Ireland and West Indies, whereas the Kookaburra is predominantly used everywhere else.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nSussex batter James Coles was one of six players to score centuries in both Kookaburra games\nWhy the Kookaburra experiment?\nThe Kookaburra is being used as a result of a high-performance review into English cricket led by Sir Andrew Strauss in 2022.\nIt came on t",

He loves the players he plays with, the staff, the team and I've never had any issue with him.\n\"I'm confident he's going to be here at the start of the season.\"\nSweden international Isak, along with Brazilian midfielder Joelinton, was missed as Howe's side were well beaten by the Scottish champions.\nCeltic went ahead after 28 minutes when Arne Engels sent Nick Pope the wrong way from the penalty spot after being brought down by Joe Willock inside the box.\nKeeper Pope made a major error to gift the hosts a second just before half-time, rushing off his line and failing with an attempt to head a long ball clear to allow Johnny Kenny to pass it into the empty net.\nNewcastle brought on Anthony Elanga,\nwho joined from Nottingham Forest\nearlier this month for \u00a355m, for his debut at the break, but the winger could not make an impact.\nCeltic added a third seven minutes after the restart when South Korean Yang Hyun-Jun slotted past replacement keeper Martin Dubravka from close range.\nDespite Newcastle having more possession in the second half, they conceded a fourth goal as Liam Scales powered a 75th-minute header into the top corner.\nThe Magpies face Arsenal in their next pre-season game on Sunday, 27 July, in Singapore (12:30 BST).\nOn whether Isak will be",

It is a massive, massive football club - similar to Newcastle in a lot of ways.\n\"It was going to take a lot for me to leave Newcastle to be honest and I wasn't just going to leave to go anywhere so it had to be the right place for me and my family and I think this is a perfect place.\n\"Every time I came to play at Leeds the atmosphere was amazing, it was always bouncing and a really tough place to play, and [I'm] just looking forward to having that on my side rather than having to play against.\"\nHe made 214 senior appearances for the Magpies, but played only 787 minutes for Eddie Howe's side in the Premier League last season - mostly as a substitute.\nLongstaff also made five appearances in the Carabao Cup last season, but was an unused substitute as Newcastle defeated Liverpool 2-1 in the final to win their domestic trophy in 70 years.\nLeeds had already agreed personal terms with the English midfielder but had an offer of \u00a310m rejected by Newcastle earlier this week.\nLongstaff is Leeds' fifth signing this summer following the arrivals of defenders\nSebastiaan Bornauw\n,\nJaka Bijol\nand\nGabriel Gudmundsson\nas well as German forward\nLukas Nmecha\n.\nDaniel Farke's side will begin their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on 18 August.\nThey play Manchester United in a pre-season friendly in Stockholm on Saturday, before further friendlies against Villarreal and AC Milan in August.\nLongstaff following in family",
