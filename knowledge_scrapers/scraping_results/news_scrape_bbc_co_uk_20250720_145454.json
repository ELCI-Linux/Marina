She saved Amel Majri's opening spot-kick to put Germany ahead, scored a penalty herself, then made sure Sara Dabritz's miss was not costly by pulling off a diving save to keep Alice Sombath out.\n\"I am not really an emotional person,\" Berger said when asked to reflect on her journey from cancer diagno",

Ivan is a big guy who lives in a village and works for his family. It's a hard punch, Ivan.\n\"The first time 2018 [I named it] was in the USA as a cruiserweight.\"\nDubois had already climbed off the canvas moments earlier following a right hook to the temple, but it was the sequence that followed with Usyk's favoured left that proved decisive.\nIt was another vintage performance from a master of the craft.\nA 90,000-strong crowd had been forced to contend with heavy rain at Wembley Stadium earlier in the night, but it was worth persevering to watch the spectacle unfold.\nUsyk excelled in all areas - escaping Dubois' attacks with slick footwork, returning with crisp shots on the counter and displaying pure heavyweight power.\nThe triumph has propelled Usyk into a very elite category - he joins Muhammad Ali as the only men to reign undisputed in the heavyweight division on two occasions.\nUsyk destroys Dubois to reclaim undisputed crown\nPublished\n16 hours ago\nRelive Usyk's demolition of Dubois at Wembley\nHeavyweight permutations - what next after Usyk win?\nPublished\n14 hours ago\nUsyk is the best of his generation\nIf it wasn't already clear then it certainly is now.

He missed them repeating the feat this season but had a prolific spell on loan at Galatasaray.\nArsenal close to finalising Gyokeres deal\nPublished\n6 days ago\nBrighton flop to hot property - is Arsenal target Gyokeres ready?\nPublished\n6 July\nWanted men\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nNewcastle's message is that Isak is not for sale but you get the feeling this isn't the last",

Might United have to consider selling some of their other players to raise funds?\nThe 'bomb squad' have been truly ousted\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nAntony, Garnacho, Rashford, Malacia and Sancho are estimated to be earning wages to a combined total of around \u00a31m a week\nOn 4 July, United made it known that the five unwanted players had asked to leave and would not train with the remainder of Amorim's squad. Rashford's number 10 shirt was given to Cunha.\nSince their exile, the only significant development involving the quintet was news that they cannot access United's Carrington training ground - which they can enter for rehabilitation and medical purposes - until Amorim and his squad have left for the day.\nThe members of the so-called 'bomb squad', a reference to their being bombed out, can train together at Ca",

You can get the latest headlines and articles (or even audio files, photographs or video) in one place, as soon as they are published, without having to remember to visit each site every day.\nRSS takes the hassle out of staying up-to-date, by showing you the very latest information that you are interested in.\nRSS feeds are just a special kind of web page, designed to be read by computers rather than people. It might help to think of them as the free, internet version of the old-fashioned ticker-tape news wire machines.\nNot all websites currently provide RSS and not all sections of the BBC or BBC Sport website are available as feeds.\nHow do I start using RSS feeds?\nIn general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader.\nThis is a piece of software that checks RSS feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added to them. There are many different versions, some of which are accessed using a browser, and some of which are downloadable applications. Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using Outlook, or keep it on a web-based service like Hotmail.\nOnce you have chosen a news reader, all you have to do is to decide what content you want to receive in your news reader, by finding and subscribing to the relevant RSS feeds. For example, if you would like the latest BBC Sport Cricket stories, simply visit the Cricket section and you will notice an orange RSS button.\nMost modern browsers, including Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome, automatically check for RSS feeds for you when you visit a website, and display the",

Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964.\nSixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer.\nJohn White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching.\nTottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers.\nRob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father.\nHis search has continued ever since.\nImage source,\nGetty\nImage caption,\nPat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964\nRob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors.\nThe day he knows best in his father's life is the last.\nIt is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path.\nOn the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane.\nHaving finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery.\nJohn White's gifts were more subtle.

Yet the stadium seats nearly 4,000.\nAnd in some style. Its roof - covered in slate tiles and copper turrets - is supported by soaring wooden columns, all set off with artful architectural lighting.\nIt is estimated to have cost more than \u00a310m.\nIt is called the Pancho Arena \u2013 part monument to Hungary's past, part statement of its future.\nImage source,\nGetty\nImage caption,\nPartizan Belgrade players and fans celebrate a win over Hungarian side Videoton at the Pancho Arena in August 2017\nSeventy years ago - 150 miles south of Stuttgart, where the two teams' met at Euro 2024 on Wednesday - Hungary faced West Germany in the World Cup final.\nHaving beaten the Germans 8-3 in the group stage, Hungary were hot favourites to win the final in Bern, Switzerland. But, after taking a two-goal lead inside eight minutes, they were sensationally defeated 3-2, losing their first game in five years and breaking a 31-match unbeaten run.\nThey never scaled such heights again.\nHungary's stellar group of players - known as the 'Mighty Magyars' or 'Golden Team' - broke up two years later, many of its members choosing not to return home after the Hungarian Uprising of October 1956 had been violently crushed by the Soviet Union.\nThe finest of them all - Hungary's captain Ferenc Puskas - wound up at Real Madrid, where he was given the nickname 'Pancho'.\nThe stadium in Felcsut bears Puskas' nickname thanks to the village's most famous resident - Hungary's football-crazy Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nFirst elected in 1998 at the age of 35, and now the longest-serving leader in the European Union, Orban has transformed Hungary,\nrewriting the country's constitution\nand election laws. What he has changed it into is open to debate. Orban has described his approach as \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian democracy\".\nIn 2022, the European Parliament opted for a \"hybrid regime of el",

Beaten in the Wimbledon final, he regrouped, returned and won Olympic gold on the same court in front of packed stands.\nHe swore. He cried. He celebrated. He felt the love.\nThis is the story of the 28 days that confirmed Murray as a national treasure.\nImage source,\nGetty\nImage caption,\nMurray watched Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford win athletics golds the night before his London 2012 final against Roger Federer\nBefore he was Sir Andrew Murray OBE, world number one, three-time Grand Slam champion, one of the nation's greatest-ever athletes... he was, to one woman at least, something altogether less celebratory.\nIn 2006, the football World Cup was taking place at the same time as Wimbledon. A 19-year-old Murray, himself once a promising youth footballer, joked in an interview that he would support \"whoever England were playing against\".\nIt went down like a lead balloon. He\nwas abused in the comments\nof a blog he wrote on his website and even his wristbands, decorated with the Scottish saltire, attracted scrutiny.\nMurray had become a lightning rod, attracting ire in an edgy Anglo-Scottish atmosphere. The previous month, the then Scottish First Minister had been criticised for\nsaying he would not be supporting England.\nBut the reaction to Murray's joke was on a far larger scale.\nIn the aftermath, Murray, playing only his second Wimbledon, walked past a spectator on the way to his match.

And it fits perfectly.\nTransvulcania is one of the world\u2019s toughest and most spectacular ultra-marathons, skirting along a volcanic ridgeline in the Canary Islands.\nIt takes place on the island of La Palma, known as La Isla Bonita for its wealth of natural beauty.\nYet in 2021 there was a devastating reminder that Mother Nature possesses beastly power as well.\nFor the first time in 50 years, that volcanic ridge erupted.\nImage source,\nGetty\nImage caption,\nBefore 2021, La Palma had been spared any volcanic eruption since 1971\nThere had been warnings. A cluster of small earthquakes started under the Cumbre Vieja ridge on 11 September.\nThen on 19 September, the eruption began a little west of the ridgeline. The first lava flows snaked down slopes.\nHomes were evacuated, livestock moved across the island and farmers raced to guard or salvage their crops.\nThere was little they could do. Houses were swamped, roads barricaded and fields buried by molten flows and layers of ash.\nTen days after the eruption had started, the lava flow completed its 6km (3.7 mile) journey across La Palma, falling, steaming, into the Atlantic Ocean.\nLa Palma\u2019s previous eruption in 1971, from the south of the same ridge, went on for a month. The 2021 eruption lasted for 85 days.\nHaving had to cancel the 2020 race because of the coronavirus pandemic, Transvulcania's organisers were left with no choice but to scratch the 2021 event.\nIn that moment, it was the least of the island's worries.\nUltimately more than 7,000 people had to be evacuated and more than 3,000 properties were destroyed, along with farmland covering roughly 1,500 football pitches.\nThe financial damage was estimated as 862.7m euros (\u00a3729m).\nNow, though, Transvulcania has returned to help La Palma recover, along with two of Britain\u2019s best trail-runners.\nImage source,\nGetty\nImage caption,\nThe lava flows damaged La Palma's agricultural industry, which is centred around bananas\nTransvulcania is a week-long festival of races over different distances, with an",
