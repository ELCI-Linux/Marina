She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest ",

At Wimbledon there will be no line judges for the first time in its 148-year history, with electronic line calling being introduced.\nPlayers and umpires have already got used to the new set-up as it has been at other tournaments for a while, but on the green grass at Wimbledon, where advertising logos are muted and the players are dressed in white, the emptier courts may feel that bit more noticeable.\n\"It's all the tradition of Wimbledon - the people and the funny uniforms - and that's a bit of personality that's gone,\" said Eyre. \"I think it's all of those little things that made Wimbledon Wimbledon.\"\nTraditionalists will miss them, but technology fans will point to progress.\nBBC Sport has been finding out what umpires, players and line judges make of the move.\nWill there be line judges at Wimbledon 2025?\nPublished\n26 June\nWhy does F",

What a joke, another confirmation we need a VAR in tennis and electronic line calling on all tournaments,\" Kasatkina posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nRussian-born Kazakh Bublik, who received a code violation for smashing his racquet earlier in the match, was awarded the win at 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-5) 6-5.\n\"I highly doubt Andrey said something crazy, he's not this kind of guy. But I guess that's the rules. That's what they did, they just follow the procedure,\" Bublik said.\n\"There's not much to say. With all due respect, it was a great match and both of us deserved to win. The crowd was there and we could have played one of the greatest matches against each other. It's a pity it ended like this.\n\"I wish Andrey to get back on track as soon as possible.\"\nBublik will face top seed Daniil Medvedev or Frenchman Ugo Humbert in Saturday's final.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\nRelated topics\nTennis\nTop stories\nUsyk and 'Ivan' - the untouchable duo who can't be beaten?\nPublished\n4 ",

A short pass to Chido Obi inside the penalty area was delivered with a delicate touch you would not normally expect of someone Leon's size.\nGoodness knows what he was like as a schoolboy in South America, but he is already a solid unit.\nThat might bring its own problems as he gets accustomed to the intensity of the Premier League and, even in this encounter - played in pleasant conditions despite the sun and mid-afternoon kick-off - Leon seemed to be catching his breath on a couple of occasions.\n\"He's [in] the first week, second week in Manchester United. He did really well. He's learning things,\" Amorim ",

A topic frequently discussed but that never goes away.\nOnly 72.3 overs were bowled on day two of the third Test at Lord's.\nThat means, including the necessary time taken for a change of innings, 15 overs were lost from the match not because of rain or bad light but because of the slowness of play.\nA further 19 overs were lost over days three and four.\nThere was\nIndian frustration\nat the end of day three as England opener Zak Crawley used delaying tactics, meaning one over took seven minutes.\nEngland have subsequently been\ndocked two points\nin the World Test Championship (WTC) and fined 10% of their match fee for a slow over-rate.\nThey were deemed to be below the required rate despite mitigating circumstances, including India captain Shubman Gill having an eight-minute massage on the outfield and Ravindra Jadeja taking a toilet break while batting on day five.\nThe stoppages are a poor look for the sport, but what are the rules, do over-rates matter and what can be done?\nWhat are the rules?\nIn a five-day Test, 90 overs are scheduled for each day.\nTo prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw, all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day, barring interruptions for the weather.\nOn the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half hour made available at the end of the day.\nWhile time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.\nThere are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have limited impact.\nAn umpire can, after an",

You could even say almost too good for this Earth. A proper angel sent from heaven.\"\nIn 2024 Kevin Campbell's life was tragically cut short after he suffered a serious illness, and an investigation was launched into concerns over his care.\nAfter his inquest concluded on Monday, this is the story of Campbell's life, loss and legacy, told by those who knew him best.\nThe Life, Loss and Legacy of Kevin Campbell\n15/4/2025\nWatch on iPlayer\nBrixton, south London, 1970-80s\nCampbell will eventually raise his own family in the north-west, but is born in south London in 1970, the second youngest of seven children in a family with Jamaican roots.\n\"We were brought up by a single mother so resources were extremely tight,\" Campbell's younger sister Lorna says. \"We used to play tennis against a back wall because we couldn't afford to hire a court. Kevin wanted to be in different football teams and it was a struggle for my mother to pay all the subs.\n\"We had three big brothers and he was never afraid to play football with them and their friends - he would just take them on. And this was on the mean streets of Brixton. That's when he came alive.\"\nImage source,\nCampbell family\nImage caption,\nKevin and his sister Lorna grew up playing sport together ",

In May, sporting director Deco admitted they \"like\" Rashford and suggested he could \"improve the team\".\nBut that is the bit that currently has people talking - could he really?\nBBC Sport tries to explain how Rashford finds himself on the brink of joining Barcelona and why they actually want to sign him.\nHow did we get to this point?\nRashford's departure from Old Trafford has been a relatively long time coming.\nManager Ruben Amorim dropped him for the Manchester derby on 15 December last year - and he has not played for United since.\nAmorim later criticised Rashford for a perceived lack of effort, suggesting that he would rather give a place on the bench to his\n63-year-old goalkeeping coach\nthan someone who \"doesn't give the maximum every day\".\nHe joined Aston Villa on loan in January, making 17 appearances and earning an England recall, but returned to Old Trafford last month with his longer-term future still uncertain.\nHowever, that uncertainty has been more about where he would go rather than whether he would stay, with Rashford one of\nfive players who told the club they wanted to leave\n- and\nwho were subsequently told to train separately\nfrom the rest of the squad.\n\"There is no doubt a fully-motivated, focused and determined Mar",

It's every day, every detail,\" said Amorim, when asked why Rashford was not available.\n\"If things don't change, I will not change. It's the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.\n\"You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\"\nSources close to Rashford had been adamant the 27-year-old has no issue with Amorim and was willing to play for the club again.\nHopes of a move to AC Milan have been dashed by the arrival of Kyle Walker as the Italian club can only sign one English player this month.\nA potential loan to Barcelona depends on the exit of a couple of players and neither Eric Garcia nor Ansu Fati have shown much inclination to leave the Nou Camp.\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Match of the Day: \"The fans aren't stupid. They see it's not good enough from the players and Ruben Amorim is just being honest.\n\"If you don't train hard and dedicate your life, you won't be in the team. You have to show your manager you deserve a place in the team.\"\nEx-Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger add",
