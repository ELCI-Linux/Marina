This has not been verified by the BBC.\nGovernment forces deployed earlier this week by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa were blamed for joining in attacks on the Druze. More than 900 people are reported to have been killed in the past week. All sides are accused of atrocities.\nThe US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, demanded an end to \"the rape and slaughter of innocent people\" in Syria, in a post on X on Saturday.\nRubio wrote: \"If authorities in Damascus want to preserve any chance of achieving a unified, inclusive and peaceful Syria free of ISIS [Islamic State] and of Iranian control they must help end this calamity by using their security forces to prevent ISIS and any other violent jihadists from entering the area and carrying out massacres.\n\"And they must hold accountable and bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks,\" the top US diplomat added.\nImage source,\nReuters\nImage caption,\nBedouin fighters have reportedly been pushed out of the city of Suweida\nOn Saturday evening, the Syrian interior ministry said clashes in Suweida had been halted after the intervention of its forces in the city.\nReuters news agency reported that fighting persisted in other parts of Suweida province.\nEarlier this week, Israel declared support for the Druze and intervened, hitting government forces and\nthe defence ministry in the capital Damascus\n.\nSharaa announced a ceasefire on Saturday as Syrian security forces were deployed to Suweida to end the clashes. The deal included a halt to Israeli military strikes and was approved by Israel as part of a US-brokered pact, as long as the Druze citizens were protected.\nGovernment troops have been setting up checkpoints to try to prevent more people joining the fighting. But gunfire was reported inside Suweida earlier on Saturday.\nA correspondent for AFP news ",

Over two runs on 21 July 1925, he recorded an average speed of 150.766mph, catapulting him to international stardom.\nNow, 100 years later, Blue Bird will be back at Pendine to mark the historic achievement.\nImage source,\nNational Motor Museum, Beaulieu\nImage caption,\nMalcolm Campbell sitting in Blue Bird ahead of his world land-speed attempt on 21 July 1925\nIt will be wheeled on to the beach for a ceremonial start-up in front of Sir Malcolm's grandson, Don Wales.\nMr Wales is just one part of Sir Malcolm's record breaking lineage.\nDonald Campbell, Sir Malcolm's son, was the only man to hold both the land and water-speed records at the same time, before he was killed at Coniston Water in the Lake District in 1967 in another record attempt.\nHis daughter Gina broke the women's world water speed record.\nWhile Mr Wales, Donald Campbell's nephew, has previously held UK and world records for the fastest electric car, steam-powered car and quickest lawnmower on Earth.\nSpeed record attempt photo sold\nPublished\n28 December 2015\nPendine racer's building honour\nPublished\n21 July 2010\nBlue Bird back to sands of triumph\nPublished\n21 July 2015\nMr Wales said: \"There's just something in our genes, I think it was Grandad's buccaneering Scottish ancestors.\n\"We're all family people, but when the red mist of racing descends, nothing matters more than burying our right foot and seeing how fast our vehicles, talent and bravery can take us.\"\nMr Wales said he thought his grandfather was unprepared for the fame the feat would bring him.\n\"He went from an aside on the back pages to the main headline in every paper, he had congratulations from the King, and suddenly everyone wanted",
