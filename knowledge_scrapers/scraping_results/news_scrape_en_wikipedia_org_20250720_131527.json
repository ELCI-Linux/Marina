It is owned by a parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, which has relatively few shares which are infrequently traded. Historically, the club has been owned by descendants of the Bracewell-Smith and Hill-Wood families.  The club attracted outside interest as two rival tycoons,\nStan Kroenke\nand\nAlisher Usmanov\n, acquired significant share holdings in 2007.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nIn August 2018, Kroenke's offer of \u00a3550 million for Usmanov's share was accepted, and Kroenke bought out the remainder of the shares to become the club's sole shareholder.\n[\n3\n]\nOverview\n[\nedit\n]\nArsenal Holdings plc, operates as a\nnon-quoted\npublic limited company\n, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,217 shares in Arsenal have been issued,\n[\n4\n]\nand they are not traded on a public exchange such as the\nFTSE\nor\nAIM\n; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on NEX Exchange (\nAFC\n), a specialist market. The 2011 takeover bid by Stan Kroenke put the club's\nmarket capitalisation\nvalue at \u00a3731m.\n[\n5\n]\nArsenal Holdings plc wholly owns twelve subsidiary companies, covering the group's activities. These include Arsenal Football Club plc (the football club itself), Arsenal (Emirates Stadium) Limited (which develops and owns Arsenal's\nEmirates Stadium\n), Arsenal Stadium Management Company (which manages the stadium on matchdays), and Arsenal Overseas Ltd (which manages retail operations). Other subsidiaries deal with\nproperty development\non the site of Arsenal's former stadium at\nHighbury\nand the associated property holding and financing.\n[\n4\n]\nFinancial performance\n[\nedit\n]\nThe club made an operating\nprofit\n(excluding player transfers) of \u00a372m in the year ending 31 May 2010, from a\nturnover\nof \u00a3379.9m.\n[\n6\n]\nIn April 2009, business magazine\nForbes\nranked Arsenal",

On top of a maximum 25 players for List A, clubs had to designate a minimum 8 players that were trained by clubs from the same national league, with 4 of them being from the club's own youth system.\n[\n1\n]\nThe rule in turn capped a maximum of 17 foreign trained players for the club in UEFA competitions.\nThe\nEnglish Premier League\nenforced their own version\nbeginning in 2010.\n[\n2\n]\nThe purpose was to encourage clubs to develop local talents instead on relying on signing players from other clubs, following the aftermath of the\nBosman ruling\n, which gave more power to richer clubs to buy talented players from smaller clubs.\n[\n1\n]\nDefinition\n[\nedit\n]\nUEFA defines locally-trained or 'homegrown' players as those who, regardless of their nationality, have been trained by their club or by another club in the same national association for at least three years between the ages of 15 and 21.\n[\n1\n]\nIt is thus possible for a player to be homegrown at up to two clubs and in two league systems.\nCriticism\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2020 the Belgium club\nRoyal Antwerp\nchallenged the legibility of the homegrown player rule in the Belgian courts when they could not register Israeli player\nLior Refaelov\n, arguing that Belgium had a natural disadvantage due the country's relatively smaller size, citing EU's competition laws.\n[\n3\n]\nThe case was later brought to the\nEuropean Court of Justice\n. Here the advocate-general\nMaciej Szpunar\ndisagreed with Royal Antwerp's argument, saying that due to the nature of the game, UEFA could have rules that seemed uncompetitive. He also wrote that \"Systems in which homegrown players include not only those trained by the club at issue but also those of other clubs in the same national league, are not compatible with free-movement rules.\u201d\n[\n3\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\n\"Protection of young players\"\n.

From the\nfollowing season\nto the\n2005\ncontest, three teams were awarded Intertoto Cups, with French managers being the most successful.\n[\n3\n]\nIn\n2006\n, the format was modified to allow eleven clubs to qualify for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, the Intertoto Cup being awarded to the team that progressed the furthest in the competition.\n[\n4\n]\nEnglishman\nGlenn Roeder\nlifted the cup that season as he guided\nNewcastle United\nto the last 16 of the\n2006\u201307 UEFA Cup\n.
