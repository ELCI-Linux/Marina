Whereas this is the Dukes in England, Tests in India are played with an SG ball, while the Kookaburra is used in Australia.\nThe Dukes, in production since 1760, has long been regarded as a high-quality product but there have been issues in Test and county cricket in recent years.\nIt has been going soft prematurely - long before it should be changed after 80 overs of an innings - and when a ball goes soft taking wickets becomes harder. Bowlers say there is not the same zip off the pitch and fewer edges carry to fielders.\nThe ECB's Professional Game Committee and Cricket Advisory Group analyses data collected in relation to balls across the season. This would include the number of balls changed, along with reports from umpires and captains.\nConversations around the quality of balls have been monitored in recent years and there is an awareness of increased instances of balls becoming softer more quickly but",

There was a massive crowd and they had turned away 10,000 people. It was obscene the amount of people who wanted to come and watch.\n\"It was like, 'wow this is something to behold'. I don't think it'll ever happen again.\"\nIt may be 20 years since arguably the most iconic Test series in Ashes history, but former England bowler Simon Jones can still see every moment in his mind's eye.\nJones' 20-20 vision is hardly surprising given the bigger picture: 2005 was England's first Ashes series win since 1987. It not only ended an 18-year, eight-series losing run but it was an endless cricketing summer that flipped the Ashes narrative.\nEngland teams since that summer have stored that storied series in their psyche somewhere. They enter with a belief that victory is an option again.\nJones' story mirrors that big-picture narrative.\nThe 2005 series \u2013\nrelived in a BBC Sport documentary on iPlayer\n\u2013 was the zenith of a career cruelly cut short by injury.\nJones took 18 wickets, including a career-best 6-53 at Trent Bridge, despite, appropriately perhaps, only playing three and a half Tests because of an ankle injury.\nDespite that setback, the former Glamorgan fast bowler remembers the summer as a once-in-a-lifetime blur of front and back-page news and Downing Street garden parties.\nIt all began at a febrile Lord's that was more stag party than traditional tea party.\nThe home of cricket is known for its serenity. Popping champagne corks rather than popping off.\nBut as Jones remembers, 2005 felt different, even before a ball was bowled.\n\"When we went through that Long Room, and we walked down the stairs and through the pavilion, it erupted,\" he says.\n\"I remember Kev [Kevin Pietersen] turning around and saying to me: 'What is going on here?'\n\"It almost shocked us really.

This makes the seam more pronounced than the Kookaburra and it maintains its shape for longer, favouring bowlers searching for seam and swing movement.\nThe Kookaburra is machine stitched and does not have the same handicraft in its manufacturing. It does swing initially, but loses its shape more quickly and becomes softer.\nHowever, it is better suited to cricket played on dry, hard pitches, as are usually found in Australia, to cope with the abrasive surfaces.\nIn Test cricket, the Dukes ball is used in England, Ireland and West Indies, whereas the Kookaburra is predominantly used everywhere else.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nSussex batter James Coles was one of six players to score centuries in both Kookaburra games\nWhy the Kookaburra experiment?\nThe Kookaburra is being used as a result of a high-performance review into English cricket led by Sir Andrew Strauss in 2022.\nIt came on t",

So much so, there was some surprise at the club that the story did not leak before it did on Monday, with confirmation of the news that bewildered the football world coming by the evening.\nThe club's US-based ownership group \u2013 who took over at the Swansea.Com Stadium in November \u2013 had been seeking an investor who could make an impact through their profile.\nDriven by majority owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen, they specifically sought someone with football gravitas and global reach. Six-times Champions League winner Modric ticks all the boxes.\nWhen it was discovered the Croatia captain had an interest in club ownership, Swansea reached out with a proposal that eventually led to this week's eye-catching announcement.\nWhat information do we collect from this quiz?\nWhy Swansea?\nModric's only words on the matter so far are those issued in Swansea's statement.\nHe speaks of the club's \"strong identity, an incredible fanbase and the ambition to compete at the highest level\".\nThere was little clue, though, as to why he has got involved at Swansea.\nThere is some talk of a link between Modric and Swansea's ownership group, with numerous new faces on the board following the takeover of the club last November.\nThere are also s",

At Wimbledon there will be no line judges for the first time in its 148-year history, with electronic line calling being introduced.\nPlayers and umpires have already got used to the new set-up as it has been at other tournaments for a while, but on the green grass at Wimbledon, where advertising logos are muted and the players are dressed in white, the emptier courts may feel that bit more noticeable.\n\"It's all the tradition of Wimbledon - the people and the funny uniforms - and that's a bit of personality that's gone,\" said Eyre. \"I think it's all of those little things that made Wimbledon Wimbledon.\"\nTraditionalists will miss them, but technology fans will point to progress.\nBBC Sport has been finding out what umpires, players and line judges make of the move.\nWill there be line judges at Wimbledon 2025?\nPublished\n26 June\nWhy does F",

I hope we'll be able to maintain it in our tournaments in the future.\"\nGet in touch\nSend us your questions\nContact form\nContact form\nRoland Garros possibly 'better' with line judges\nElectronic line calling uses cameras, computers and sensors to track a ball and is used by tennis umpires to judge whether a ball is in or out.\nIt has been claimed the red dust layer on the clay courts of Roland Garros compromises the accuracy and reliability of the technology because it is a 'live' surface which moves during the match.\nBut Paul Hawkins, the inventor of electronic line calling system Hawk-Eye, says the technology is accurate on the surface and it is the mark left by the ball on the clay that is not accurate.\n\"It's like a cliff edge [the plastic white line], so [the ball] can hit that part of the line and then carry on travelling forwards and not actually hit the clay until four or five millimetres beyond the line, which would then be where you would begin to see a mark on the court,\" Hawkins told BBC Sport.\n\"The mark on the court looks like it is out whereas actually it has clipped the line.\"\nHowever, Hawkins believes Roland Garros is possibly \"better\" without electronic line calling and says that if players looking at the mark - which has been done for more than a century - is accepted",
