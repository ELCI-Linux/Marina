Over that period, desktop screens have got larger, technology has changed to allow us to present things in a clearer way, and design aesthetics have changed.\nFor some time you have been asking for a more up-to-date website, one that has a larger text size, to make it easier to read. We always listen to what you tell us and we have been working to make some changes to the website to accommodate your requests.\nWhat has stayed the same\nAll of the legislation content and all of the functionality you are used to has stayed the same. The new design is purely that - a change to its appearance; everything works in the same way that you are familiar with.\nOur website - whilst viewable on mobile devices - is not yet optimised for mob",
