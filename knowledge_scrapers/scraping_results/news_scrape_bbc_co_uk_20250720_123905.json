Now everything is dry.\" She gestures to some grazing llamas.\nFor generations, her family raised sheep here. As the climate changed, and rain stopped falling, less grass made that much harder.\nBut it worsened when \"they\" started taking the water, she explains.\nImage source,\nBen Derico/BBC\nImage caption,\nRaquel's family raised sheep in Chile's Atacama salt flats for generations but now everything is dry, she says\n\"They\" are lithium companies. Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage.\nAs the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared.\nIn 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nBy 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes.\nMost of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says.\nLocals say environmental costs to them have risen too.\nSo, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem?\nFlora, flamingos and shrinking lagoons\nChile is the second-largest producer of lithium globally after Australia. In 2023, the government launched a National Lithium Strategy to ramp up production through partly nationalising the industry and encouraging private investment.\nIts finance minister previously said the increase in production could be by up to 70% by 2030, although the mining ministry says no target has been set.\nThis year, a major milestone to that is set to be reached.\nImage source,\nBen Derico/BBC\nImage caption,\nThe process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region\nA planned joint enterprise between SQM and Chile's state mining company Codelco has just secured regulatory approval for a quota to extract at least 2.5 million metric tonn",

Should it really be served in restaurants?\nPublished\n25 June 2025\nPallab Ghosh\nScience correspondent\n@BBCPallab\nInside an anonymous building in Oxford, Riley Jackson is frying a steak. The perfectly red fillet cut sizzles in the pan, its juices releasing a meaty aroma. But this is no ordinary steak. It was grown in the lab next door.\nWhat's strangest of all is just how real it looks. The texture, when cut, is indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\"That's our goal,\" says Ms Jackson of Ivy Farm Technologies, the food tech start-up that created it. \"We want it to be as close to a normal steak as possible.\"\nLab-grown meat is already sold in many parts of the world and in a couple of years, pending being granted regulatory approval, it could also be sold in the UK too - in burgers, pies and sausages.\nUnlike so-called vegetarian meat, which is already available in UK supermarkets -  from fake bacon rashers made from pea protein to steaks made of soy, and dyed bright red to resemble the real thing - lab-grown meat is biologically real meat, grown from cow cells.\nImage source,\nIvy Farm Technologies\nImage caption,\nThe lab-grown steak from Ivy Farm Technologies has a texture indistinguishable from regular steak\nTo some, this could be a smart technological fix for a growing environmental problem: the rise in planet-heating gases caused, in part, by the rapid and growing demand for meat.\nBut others argue that the environmental benefits of lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, have been oversold. Some critics say that more effort should instead be expended on reducing meat consumption, instead of looking to a technology fix.\nThen there are questions around the ultra-processed nature of this meat, which some also worry will be produced by a handful of multinational companies.\nSo now, with dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats having\nalready gone on sale in the UK\nearlier this year and with the possibility of lab-grown food for humans becoming available sooner than expected - the debate has never been more prescient.\nNor has the question: to grow or not to grow?\nCurbing greenhouse gas emissions\nGlobal demand for meat is growing. According the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, meat production has increased fivefold since the 1960s and reached around 364 million tonnes in 2023.\nProducing 1kg of beef can generate planet-heating greenhouse gases, equivalent to roughly 40kg of carbon dioxide, though estimates can vary depending on the type of p",

Over two runs on 21 July 1925, he recorded an average speed of 150.766mph, catapulting him to international stardom.\nNow, 100 years later, Blue Bird will be back at Pendine to mark the historic achievement.\nImage source,\nNational Motor Museum, Beaulieu\nImage caption,\nMalcolm Campbell sitting in Blue Bird ahead of his world land-speed attempt on 21 July 1925\nIt will be wheeled on to the beach for a ceremonial start-up in front of Sir Malcolm's grandson, Don Wales.\nMr Wales is just one part of Sir Malcolm's record breaking lineage.\nDonald Campbell, Sir Malcolm's son, was the only man to hold both the land and water-speed records at the same time, before he was killed at Coniston Water in the Lake District in 1967 in another record attempt.\nHis daughter Gina broke the women's world water speed record.\nWhile Mr Wales, Donald Campbell's nephew, has previously held UK and world records for the fastest electric car, steam-powered car and quickest lawnmower on Earth.\nSpeed record attempt photo sold\nPublished\n28 December 2015\nPendine racer's building honour\nPublished\n21 July 2010\nBlue Bird back to sands of triumph\nPublished\n21 July 2015\nMr Wales said: \"There's just something in our genes, I think it was Grandad's buccaneering Scottish ancestors.\n\"We're all family people, but when the red mist of racing descends, nothing matters more than burying our right foot and seeing how fast our vehicles, talent and bravery can take us.\"\nMr Wales said he thought his grandfather was unprepared for the fame the feat would bring him.\n\"He went from an aside on the back pages to the main headline in every paper, he had congratulations from the King, and suddenly everyone wanted",

In fact, he says, he regrets ever having started using pouches. He now sees himself as an addict and wants to warn others.\n\"I just got bored of vaping, and now I'm stuck on these.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nA growing number of young people are using nicotine pouches - some swapping from vaping or smoking, others trying nicotine for the first time.\nFigures seen by BBC News suggest there has been nearly a four-fold rise in use by 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK - from less than than 1% in 2022, to 3.6% in 2024.\nThe pouches are widely sold online, in supermarkets and in corner shops. Priced at around \u00a35 for a pack of 20, they come in exotic flavours with varying nicotine strengths - from 1.5mg to claims of 150mg for a more \"extreme\" experience.\nAnyone can buy them. There is no minimum age as with cigarettes, vapes and alcohol. Nor is there any restriction on the strength of the nicotine in the pouches.\n\"I've heard of children as young as 11 or 12 nipping to shops and buying them,\" warns Kate Pike, Trading Standards' lead officer for tobacco and vaping.\nShe says her organisation is receiving an increasing number of reports from parents and teachers that nicotine pouches are being sold to children.\n\"It is incredibly frustrating that there is nothing we can currently do to pr",

She did not look like someone you'd expect to be carrying out a drug deal - her defence barrister said she \"was undoubtedly singled out as someone who would not catch the eye\".\nThat woman was Deborah Mason, known to family as Gangsta Debbs or Queen Bee: a grandmother and the matriarch of a crime family that operated across south east England.\nMason had recruited her four children, her sister and others close to the family to help supply cocaine around the country - funding a lavish lifestyle which included Gucci designer goods bought for her cat and a \u00a3192 Bugatti kettle.\nOn Friday, the 65-year-old was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs at Woolwich Crown Court.\nThe rest of the gang received sentences of between 10 and 15 years for the same charge.\nImage source,\nMetropolitan Police\nImage caption,\nDeborah Mason referred to herself as Gangsta Debbs. Her daughter, Demi Bright, had her mother's number saved in her phone as 'Queen Bee'\nThe Metropolitan Police watched Mason for seven months after that morning in Harwich, as she and her family-run gang completed cocaine and class A drug pick-ups at ports - mainly Harwich - but also Folkestone and Dover.\nThe pattern was often the same. Tightly wrapped packages of cocaine would be collected, divided between supermarket bags for life and then delivered to the next person in the chain.\nPolice watched the gang complete drop-offs in south London, Cardiff, Bristol, Sheffield, Rotherham, Manchester, Bradford, Southend, Leicester and Walsall.\nOne man arrested by police in Leicester shortly after a handover was found with 10kg (22lbs) of cocaine. Other trips would be to collect their \"wages\" as they described it.\nImage source,\nMet Police\nImage caption,\nThe gang were caught supplying nearly a tonne of cocaine over seven months\nIn total the drugs the gang handled were worth \u00a325m-\u00a330m at wholesale, with a street value of up to \u00a380m, the prosecution said during Friday's sentencing hearing.\nThe cou",

Someone off stage kept trying to take it off him. Incredible.\"\nThe identity of the cast member is unclear, but Il trovatore has now finished its 11-night run at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nThe protest comes as the war between Israel and Gaza continues, with a ceasefire yet to be struck.\nGet in touch\nWere you at the performance?\nContact form\nContact form\nRelated topics\nOpera\nLondon\nTop stories\nSewage discharges to halve by 2030, minister pledges\nPublished\n1 hour ago\nAt least 14 dead in South Korea floods and landslides\nPublished\n3 hours ago\nNew criminal offence to target violence-obsessed suspects earlier\nPublished\n11 hours ago\nMore to explore\nHow the rise ",

Of course our job should be on the line if we don't,\" he said.\nImage source,\nPA Media\nThe pledge forms part of wider government plans to improve the water sector, ahead of the Water Commission review of the industry being published on Monday.\nJames Wallace, chief executive of charity River Action UK, said the target seemed \"admirable\" but that ultimately it was a \"political pledge\" and not legally binding.\nThe plans announced on Sunday will also include",
